Welcome to my blog! ðŸŽ‰

This is my very first post. Iâ€™ve been learning web development and wanted a space to document my journey and share what I discover.

## Why start a blog?

- To track my progress
- To teach others what I learn
- To improve my writing and communication

Stay tuned â€” Iâ€™ll be posting tutorials, thoughts, and small experiments here.

Thanks for reading! ðŸ™Œ
